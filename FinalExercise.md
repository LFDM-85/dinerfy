## Final Exercise– Build a restaurant website

1- Build a HTML page that has a Top Bar, when a user click in any of the elements of the top bar the page must scroll to it; ✔️

2- Build a About section, where you will talk about the restaurant; ✔️

3- Build a Menu section, where you are going to display the plates list for the week. The data that will feed this section can change so the plates part must be built in JavaScript (the plates object is provided in the next page); ✔️

4- Create a way for user to login, register or logout in the website. At this stage use localStorage to keep user logged in; ✔️

5 -In case user is logged in, a new section is available which is a Schedule section, there the user can book one or several days of the week and choose if he wants the meat or the fish plate. At the end of the section he can see the total price. The options selected by the user must be saved in
localStorage; ✔️
